# What's New

New features, improvements, and notable changes in each SQLRooms release. For migration steps and breaking changes, see the [Upgrade Guide](/upgrade-guide).

## 0.26.1-rc.7 (2025-12-05)

### Replaced barrel exports across all modules

Barrel exports (i.e., `export * from ...`) were replaced across all modules to improve tree-shaking, reduce bundle size, and avoid import path ambiguities. Direct/explicit exports now ensure only the required symbols are included in consumers' builds, making dependencies clearer and preventing accidental re-exports or circular dependencies.

Additionally, `"sideEffects": false` was added to all packages. This signals to bundlers that the modules are free of side effects, enabling better tree-shaking and further reducing the final bundle size.

### TabStrip component in `@sqlrooms/ui`

A composable tab strip with drag-to-reorder, inline renaming, and a search dropdown for reopening closed tabs. Supports custom tab menus and flexible layouts via subcomponents (`TabStrip.Tabs`, `TabStrip.SearchDropdown`, `TabStrip.NewButton`).

### Kepler integration

Added [Kepler.gl](https://kepler.gl/) integration module for geospatial data visualization.

Check the [Kepler example](https://github.com/sqlrooms/examples/tree/main/kepler)

### AI RAG module

New `@sqlrooms/ai-rag` module for Retrieval Augmented Generation. Query your documentation using vector similarity search powered by DuckDB's native vector capabilities.
