# What's New

New features, improvements, and notable changes in each SQLRooms release. For migration steps and breaking changes, see the [Upgrade Guide](/upgrade-guide).

## 0.27.0-rc.5

### `@sqlrooms/room-store`: bound `useRoomStore` API + `useRoomStoreApi`

`useRoomStore` now exposes imperative Zustand store methods (`getState`, `setState`, `subscribe`, `getInitialState`) in addition to selector usage. This makes event handlers and async callbacks more ergonomic while preserving existing reactive selector patterns.

For context-based access, use the new `useRoomStoreApi()` hook to read/write state imperatively from components wrapped in `RoomStateProvider`.

### Introducing MosaicSlice

A new centralized state management system for Mosaic integration. The `MosaicSlice` provides a unified way to manage Mosaic connections, coordinate cross-filtering between visualizations, and create reactive data queries that automatically update based on user selections.

Key features:

* Automatic connection management with DuckDB
* Named selections for cross-filtering between multiple visualizations
* `useMosaicClient` hook for custom visualization clients
* Support for custom visualizations that respond to Mosaic selections

See the [Mosaic API documentation](/api/mosaic/) for details and check out the [DeckGL + Mosaic example](examples#deck-gl-mosaic) for a complete implementation.

## 0.26.1-rc.7 (2025-12-05)

### Replaced barrel exports across all modules

Barrel exports (i.e., `export * from ...`) were replaced across all modules to improve tree-shaking, reduce bundle size, and avoid import path ambiguities. Direct/explicit exports now ensure only the required symbols are included in consumers' builds, making dependencies clearer and preventing accidental re-exports or circular dependencies.

Additionally, `"sideEffects": false` was added to all packages. This signals to bundlers that the modules are free of side effects, enabling better tree-shaking and further reducing the final bundle size.

### TabStrip component in `@sqlrooms/ui`

A composable tab strip with drag-to-reorder, inline renaming, and a search dropdown for reopening closed tabs. Supports custom tab menus and flexible layouts via subcomponents (`TabStrip.Tabs`, `TabStrip.SearchDropdown`, `TabStrip.NewButton`).

New: the search dropdown can optionally sort items by recent usage via `sortSearchItems="recent"` and an optional `getTabLastOpenedAt` accessor.

### Kepler integration

Added [Kepler.gl](https://kepler.gl/) integration module for geospatial data visualization.

Check the [Kepler example](https://github.com/sqlrooms/examples/tree/main/kepler)

### AI RAG module

New `@sqlrooms/ai-rag` module for Retrieval Augmented Generation. Query your documentation using vector similarity search powered by DuckDB's native vector capabilities.

Check the [AI RAG example](https://github.com/sqlrooms/examples/tree/main/ai-rag)

## 0.26.0 (2025-11-17)

### AI SDK v5

We migrated to Vercel AI SDK v5. Now supporting agents: check the [ai-agent example](https://github.com/sqlrooms/sqlrooms/tree/main/examples/ai-agent)
