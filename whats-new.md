# What's New

New features, improvements, and notable changes in each SQLRooms release. For migration steps and breaking changes, see the [Upgrade Guide](/upgrade-guide).

## 0.29.0 (upcoming)

SQLRooms 0.29 expands the project from a collection of analytics components
into a more complete, composable workspace for documents, dashboards, maps,
queries, and AI-assisted exploration. This is a large release with breaking
changes; applications upgrading from 0.28 should review the
[0.29 upgrade guide](/upgrade-guide#_0-29-0-upcoming).

### Documents, blocks, and artifacts

The new `@sqlrooms/blocks` and `@sqlrooms/documents` packages provide reusable
primitives for rich-text documents containing live SQL, Python, chart, map, and
other stateful blocks. Documents can embed charts as image assets, expose block
settings, and participate in AI editing through the same command and artifact
mechanisms used by the rest of SQLRooms
([#666](https://github.com/sqlrooms/sqlrooms/pull/666),
[#603](https://github.com/sqlrooms/sqlrooms/pull/603),
[#612](https://github.com/sqlrooms/sqlrooms/pull/612)).

Reusable query blocks and artifact tabs make these surfaces easier to compose
inside applications ([#669](https://github.com/sqlrooms/sqlrooms/pull/669)).
The former "worksheet" terminology now uses block documents. Structured
artifacts and commands use `block-document` / `block-document.*`; Markdown
artifacts and commands use `markdown-document` / `markdown-document.*`, with
`MarkdownDocumentsSlice*` APIs and the `markdownDocuments` store key
([#878](https://github.com/sqlrooms/sqlrooms/pull/878),
[#903](https://github.com/sqlrooms/sqlrooms/pull/903),
[#904](https://github.com/sqlrooms/sqlrooms/pull/904)). See the
[document naming migration guide](/upgrade-guide#sqlroomsdocuments-canonical-document-names-breaking)
for API changes and local workspace preservation.

The new [Artifacts](/artifacts) and
[Blocks and Block Documents](/blocks-and-documents) developer guides explain
how these layers compose and who owns persisted feature state.

`@sqlrooms/artifacts` now models AI session/artifact relationships as
many-to-many `sessionArtifactLinks`, allowing one chat to work across several
artifacts while keeping workspace state separate from chat associations
([#844](https://github.com/sqlrooms/sqlrooms/pull/844)). The prerelease-only
`aiSessionArtifacts` and `artifactCreators` representations were removed; see
the [upgrade guide](/upgrade-guide#sqlroomsartifacts-artifact-ai-sessions-use-pure-many-to-many-associations-breaking).

### AI SDK v6 and composable chat

The AI packages now use AI SDK v6 and `ToolLoopAgent`. SQLRooms tools use native
AI SDK definitions, while tool rendering is registered separately so the same
tool can be reused across different interfaces
([#497](https://github.com/sqlrooms/sqlrooms/pull/497),
[#800](https://github.com/sqlrooms/sqlrooms/pull/800)).

Chat is now exposed as a compound, composable UI API with unstyled composer and
prompt-suggestion primitives ([#871](https://github.com/sqlrooms/sqlrooms/pull/871)).
This release also adds chat history, transcript search, session forking, file
attachments, persisted errors, active status rendering, and opt-in timeouts
([#698](https://github.com/sqlrooms/sqlrooms/pull/698),
[#695](https://github.com/sqlrooms/sqlrooms/pull/695),
[#716](https://github.com/sqlrooms/sqlrooms/pull/716),
[#890](https://github.com/sqlrooms/sqlrooms/pull/890),
[#814](https://github.com/sqlrooms/sqlrooms/pull/814)).

### Commands, skills, and agent capabilities

Commands can declare keyboard shortcuts and run through middleware and telemetry
hooks. `createRoomShellSlice` accepts the same command configuration, allowing
the UI, application code, and agents to invoke a shared, inspectable command
model. See the [Commands guide](/commands) for the full API.

`@sqlrooms/ai` adds a skills subsystem and authoring wizard
([#574](https://github.com/sqlrooms/sqlrooms/pull/574)). The CLI builds on the
same primitives with an MCP capability runtime, named capability profiles,
separate chat and artifact navigation, and tools that can capture rendered
charts, maps, and documents for visual inspection
([#845](https://github.com/sqlrooms/sqlrooms/pull/845),
[#859](https://github.com/sqlrooms/sqlrooms/pull/859),
[#891](https://github.com/sqlrooms/sqlrooms/pull/891),
[#889](https://github.com/sqlrooms/sqlrooms/pull/889)).

### Mosaic dashboards and data exploration

`@sqlrooms/mosaic` now includes chart builders, composable dashboards, AI
dashboard tools, and a table profiler for building Quake-style cross-filtered
data inspectors
([#473](https://github.com/sqlrooms/sqlrooms/pull/473),
[#539](https://github.com/sqlrooms/sqlrooms/pull/539),
[#527](https://github.com/sqlrooms/sqlrooms/pull/527)). Data table explorer
blocks bring per-column summaries and paged Arrow rows into dashboards
([#668](https://github.com/sqlrooms/sqlrooms/pull/668)).

The profiler API pairs `useMosaicProfiler` with `MosaicProfilerHeader`,
`MosaicProfilerRows`, and `MosaicProfilerStatusBar`, keeping rendering
React-driven while following Mosaic coordinator and cross-filter lifecycle.

Charts gain box plots, configurable count metrics, multiple line-series and
aggregations, better data-limit reporting, and row-count line charts
([#588](https://github.com/sqlrooms/sqlrooms/pull/588),
[#591](https://github.com/sqlrooms/sqlrooms/pull/591),
[#787](https://github.com/sqlrooms/sqlrooms/pull/787),
[#900](https://github.com/sqlrooms/sqlrooms/pull/900)).

### Maps and spatial visualization

Deck.gl maps gain GeoArrow layers, overlaid integration, split views, richer
appearance controls, reusable AI map tools, and direct document blocks
([#549](https://github.com/sqlrooms/sqlrooms/pull/549),
[#661](https://github.com/sqlrooms/sqlrooms/pull/661),
[#701](https://github.com/sqlrooms/sqlrooms/pull/701),
[#841](https://github.com/sqlrooms/sqlrooms/pull/841)). New maps use keyless
OpenFreeMap vector basemaps by default, while Mapbox remains available when a
token is configured ([#897](https://github.com/sqlrooms/sqlrooms/pull/897)).

Kepler map selection and tab ownership now compose with artifacts instead of
maintaining a separate host-level current-map state
([#595](https://github.com/sqlrooms/sqlrooms/pull/595)).

### Layout and workspace persistence

The layout packages now use n-ary docking and grid primitives backed by
`react-resizable-panels`, including per-panel sizing constraints and persisted
resize state
([#552](https://github.com/sqlrooms/sqlrooms/pull/552),
[#575](https://github.com/sqlrooms/sqlrooms/pull/575),
[#594](https://github.com/sqlrooms/sqlrooms/pull/594),
[#631](https://github.com/sqlrooms/sqlrooms/pull/631)). The configuration shape
and several public types changed; consult the upgrade guide before loading
persisted 0.28 layouts.

### DuckDB and query results

The SQLRooms Python packages now target DuckDB 1.5.3. The 0.29.0 JavaScript
runtimes use `@duckdb/node-api` 1.4.4-r.3 and `@duckdb/duckdb-wasm` 1.32.0.
DuckDB integrations also have more consistent qualified-table and multi-schema handling
([#659](https://github.com/sqlrooms/sqlrooms/pull/659),
[#734](https://github.com/sqlrooms/sqlrooms/pull/734)).
`@sqlrooms/duckdb-node` converts results through DuckDB's Arrow IPC support,
preserving declared Arrow types for values such as `BIGINT`, `DATE`, `DECIMAL`,
and `BLOB` ([#887](https://github.com/sqlrooms/sqlrooms/pull/887)). This changes
runtime value types and requires the DuckDB `nanoarrow` extension; see the
[migration note](/upgrade-guide#sqlroomsduckdb-node-query-results-now-use-duckdb-arrow-ipc-breaking).

### UI notifications

`Toaster` now renders [Sonner](https://sonner.emilkowal.ski/) with SQLRooms
theme-aware styling, and `@sqlrooms/ui` exports Sonner's `toast` function for
application notifications ([#397](https://github.com/sqlrooms/sqlrooms/pull/397)).

## 0.28.0

* **Tailwind v4**: SQLRooms now uses Tailwind v4, including the new CSS-first setup that simplifies project styling and configuration ([#324](https://github.com/sqlrooms/sqlrooms/pull/324)). For Tailwind migration details, jump to the [upgrade guide](/upgrade-guide#tailwind-v3-to-v4).
* **Cosmos.gl upgrade**: updates the [Cosmos.gl](https://cosmos.gl) integration to include the latest improvements in this powerful graph visualization library ([#379](https://github.com/sqlrooms/sqlrooms/pull/379))
* **Command system implementation**: Command Palette UI added to shells (toggle with `Ctrl/Cmd+K`, sidebar button, searchable/grouped commands, per-command shortcuts, JSON input editor, and programmatic open/close controls). A global command system and tooling is also introduced to register, list, validate, and execute commands, with adapters for CLI/MCP and AI tool integrations, plus DB and editor command sets ([#382](https://github.com/sqlrooms/sqlrooms/pull/382))

## 0.27.0

### `@sqlrooms/data-table`: RowSelection API

`DataTablePaginated` now includes a first-class row selection API with checkbox support.

* `enableRowSelection`: enables the checkbox column
* `rowSelection`: controlled row selection state
* `onRowSelectionChange`: callback fired when selection changes

Checkbox clicks are handled independently from row click handlers, so selecting via checkbox does not double-toggle rows.

Example:

```tsx
import {RowSelectionState} from '@sqlrooms/data-table';
import {useState} from 'react';

const [rowSelection, setRowSelection] = useState<RowSelectionState>({});

<DataTablePaginated
  {...arrowTableData}
  enableRowSelection={true}
  rowSelection={rowSelection}
  onRowSelectionChange={setRowSelection}
  onRowClick={({row}) => {
    setRowSelection((prev) => ({
      ...prev,
      [row.index]: !prev[row.index],
    }));
  }}
/>;
```

### `@sqlrooms/room-store`: bound `useRoomStore` API + `useRoomStoreApi`

`useRoomStore` now exposes imperative Zustand store methods (`getState`, `setState`, `subscribe`, `getInitialState`) in addition to selector usage. This makes event handlers and async callbacks more ergonomic while preserving existing reactive selector patterns.

For context-based access, use the new `useRoomStoreApi()` hook to read/write state imperatively from components wrapped in `RoomStateProvider`.

### Introducing MosaicSlice

A new centralized state management system for Mosaic integration. The `MosaicSlice` provides a unified way to manage Mosaic connections, coordinate cross-filtering between visualizations, and create reactive data queries that automatically update based on user selections.

Key features:

* Automatic connection management with DuckDB
* Named selections for cross-filtering between multiple visualizations
* `useMosaicClient` hook for custom visualization clients
* Support for custom visualizations that respond to Mosaic selections

See the [Mosaic API documentation](/api/mosaic/) for details and check out the [DeckGL + Mosaic example](examples#deck-gl-mosaic) for a complete implementation.

### Additional 0.27.0 highlights

* **AI**: parallel sessions, persisted open session tabs, provider options, prompt suggestion improvements, inline API-key prompt in chat, and output copy-to-clipboard.
* **Vega/Charts**: actions toolbar, chart sizing fixes, improved SQL error display, hover-only chart actions, and responsive chart labels.
* **Kepler**: configurable injector with custom recipes, legend/timeline fixes, and stability improvements across integration edge cases.
* **Room/store + persistence**: `storeKey` support in `createRoomStore` and `persistSliceConfigs` helper improvements.
* **SQL/editor + query UX**: improved explain output, query panel/tab mapping fixes, and query cancellation support in create-table flows.

## 0.26.1-rc.7 (2025-12-05)

### Replaced barrel exports across all modules

Barrel exports (i.e., `export * from ...`) were replaced across all modules to improve tree-shaking, reduce bundle size, and avoid import path ambiguities. Direct/explicit exports now ensure only the required symbols are included in consumers' builds, making dependencies clearer and preventing accidental re-exports or circular dependencies.

Additionally, `"sideEffects": false` was added to all packages. This signals to bundlers that the modules are free of side effects, enabling better tree-shaking and further reducing the final bundle size.

### TabStrip component in `@sqlrooms/ui`

A composable tab strip with drag-to-reorder, inline renaming, and a search dropdown for reopening closed tabs. Supports custom tab menus and flexible layouts via subcomponents (`TabStrip.Tabs`, `TabStrip.SearchDropdown`, `TabStrip.NewButton`).

New: the search dropdown can optionally sort items by recent usage via `sortSearchItems="recent"` and an optional `getTabLastOpenedAt` accessor.

### Kepler integration

Added [Kepler.gl](https://kepler.gl/) integration module for geospatial data visualization.

Check the [Kepler example](https://github.com/sqlrooms/examples/tree/main/kepler)

### AI RAG module

New `@sqlrooms/ai-rag` module for Retrieval Augmented Generation. Query your documentation using vector similarity search powered by DuckDB's native vector capabilities.

Check the [AI RAG example](https://github.com/sqlrooms/examples/tree/main/ai-rag)

## 0.26.0 (2025-11-17)

### AI SDK v5

We migrated to Vercel AI SDK v5. Now supporting agents: check the [ai-agent example](https://github.com/sqlrooms/sqlrooms/tree/main/examples/ai-agent)
