# Case Studies

Built something with SQLRooms? We'd love to feature it!

[Submit your app](https://github.com/sqlrooms/sqlrooms/discussions/categories/case-studies) to be included on this page.

## [Foursquare Spatial Desktop](https://foursquare.com/products/spatial-desktop)

[Foursquare Spatial Desktop](https://foursquare.com/products/spatial-desktop) is a powerful geospatial computing tool that transforms your desktop into a comprehensive spatial analysis environment. Built on SQLRooms, it delivers native DuckDB query performance and real-time visualization rendering—all powered natively on your machine without requiring server infrastructure.

Key features include:

* **Native DuckDB Performance**: Run complex spatial queries on multi-GB datasets with native DuckDB integration without cloud compute dependence
* **Real-time Rendering**: Harness Kepler.gl's visualization excellence to render millions of points with interactive filtering and smooth animations
* **Modern Spatial Formats**: Native support for GeoParquet, PMTiles, and other formats GIS professionals need
* **Flexible Data Management**: Save projects locally or to personal cloud storage without internet connectivity requirements
* **Offline Capability**: Full analytical power available without cloud dependencies

## [Flowmap City](https://www.flowmap.city/)

[Flowmap City](https://www.flowmap.city/) is a powerful web-based platform for visualizing and analyzing mobility data and origin-destination flows. The application helps urban planners, transportation analysts, and researchers understand movement patterns in cities and regions.

The platform enables users to upload their own mobility datasets and create interactive visualizations that can be shared with stakeholders or embedded in other applications.

Key features include:

* **Flow Visualization**: Analyze origin-destination patterns with interactive flow maps
* **Mobility Analysis**: Study commuting patterns, transportation demand, and traffic flows
* **Temporal Patterns**: Explore how movement patterns change over time and seasons
* **Multi-modal Analysis**: Compare different transportation modes and their usage
* **Infrastructure Planning**: Make data-driven decisions for transportation infrastructure
* **Interactive Filtering**: Filter and analyze specific routes, regions, or time periods

## [Cosmograph](https://cosmograph.app/)

[Cosmograph](https://cosmograph.app/) is a powerful web-based application for visualizing and analyzing large graph datasets and machine learning embeddings. The application runs entirely in the browser, leveraging your GPU for all computations while keeping your data private and secure. The upcoming version of Cosmograph is being built using SQLRooms to enhance its data processing capabilities and analytical features.

Key features include:

* **Network Graph Visualization**: Analyze complex relationships and patterns in graph data
* **ML Embeddings Analysis**: Visualize and explore machine learning embeddings in 2D space
* **Temporal Analysis**: Study how relationships and patterns evolve over time
* **Community Detection**: Identify clusters and anomalies within your data
* **Interactive Analysis**: Use filters and histograms to explore data distributions
* **GPU-Accelerated**: Performs all calculations locally using your GPU for optimal performance

## [Transcality](https://www.transcality.com/)

[Transcality](https://www.transcality.com/) is a Swiss company building transport modeling software using SQLRooms. Their platform creates digital twins of transportation systems, enabling planners and engineers to simulate infrastructure changes—like adding or closing a road—and immediately see the effects on traffic flow.

By leveraging SQLRooms, Transcality enables visualization, filtering, and aggregation of simulation results to run directly on end-users' machines, providing fast and interactive exploration of traffic scenarios.

Key features include:

* **Traffic Flow Modeling**: Simulate and analyze traffic patterns at various resolutions
* **Infrastructure Scenarios**: Model the impact of road closures, new routes, or construction
* **Digital Transportation Twins**: Build comprehensive models of transportation systems
* **Local Data Exploration**: Visualize, filter, and aggregate simulation results directly in the browser
