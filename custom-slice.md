# How Create a Custom Slice

A custom module typically bundles **state** (via a slice) with **UI** (via one or more panels) so it can be plugged into any room.

### Slice

Create a Zustand slice (e.g. `createMyModuleSlice`) that adds new state, selectors, and actions to the Room Store.\
Expose a `config` sub-object if you want part of that state to be persisted and validated.

### Panels

Build React components for the module's UI (tables, charts, wizards, etc.).\
Register them with the module so the Layout can discover them and users can open them from the sidebar or programmatically.

Combining the slice (logic/state) with the panels (presentation) lets you ship an encapsulated feature—like an AI assistant or advanced visualization toolkit—as a reusable package.
