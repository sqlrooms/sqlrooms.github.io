# @sqlrooms/ai-core

Core AI slice, chat UI primitives, and tool-streaming utilities for SQLRooms.

Use `@sqlrooms/ai-core` when you want lower-level control over AI state/transport/UI.
For most apps, use the higher-level `@sqlrooms/ai` package.

## Installation

```bash
npm install @sqlrooms/ai-core @sqlrooms/room-store @sqlrooms/ui zod ai
```

`@sqlrooms/ui` is a peer dependency used for Chat UI rendering/styling.
You typically import Chat components from `@sqlrooms/ai-core`, but `@sqlrooms/ui` must be installed for the visual components to work.

## Store setup (core mode)

`createAiSlice` requires:

* `tools` – an AI SDK `ToolSet` (created via the `tool()` helper from `ai`)
* `getInstructions`
* `toolRenderers` (optional) – a `ToolRendererRegistry` mapping tool names to React components
* `getAvailableModels` (optional) – returns selectable `{provider, value}` pairs so new sessions can fall back to the first available model when the configured default is missing
* `getCustomModel` (optional) – returns a pre-constructed AI SDK `LanguageModel`, bypassing the OpenAI-compatible fallback entirely. Use this when a model is produced some other way, e.g. an app streaming through a server-side model proxy so no API key ever reaches the browser.

The built-in OpenAI-compatible chat transport sends images returned by tools as
image attachments immediately after the corresponding tool-result batch. This
avoids the adapter serializing image pixels as JSON text. Tool-call IDs and
text results are preserved, and persisted chat messages are unchanged. Custom
models keep their own native tool-output handling.

Send readiness (`ai.hasResolvableModel()`) reflects whichever of these paths can produce a model, so apps relying solely on `getCustomModel` do not need to register a phantom entry in `@sqlrooms/ai-settings`'s model list just to satisfy the composer's UI check. The predicate only checks that `getCustomModel` **was configured**; it never calls it.

Its counterpart `ai.requiresApiKey()` reports whether the path in effect needs a browser-held key at all — `false` when a `chatEndPoint` is configured (the remote transport sends server-side, so no key reaches the browser), and `false` when `getCustomModel` is configured **and currently returns a model**, since that model carries its own credentials. A configured factory returning `undefined` still needs a key, because the transport then falls back to the built-in OpenAI-compatible client. Unlike `hasResolvableModel()`, this predicate therefore invokes the factory: guessing optimistically about readiness only risks a failed send, but guessing optimistically about credentials hides the only UI for entering one. The result is cached per resolved provider/model pair — keyed, so returning to a previously selected model does not re-probe — meaning a mounted composer asks the factory once per distinct selection rather than once per store update. Keep it idempotent for a given selection. The composer's `needsApiKey` is gated on it, so an app behind a server-side proxy is never asked for a key it has no use for.

Both model paths consult `getCustomModel`: the chat transport, and the one-shot `ai.sendPrompt()` helper. In `sendPrompt` a resolved custom model also wins over the `modelProvider`, `modelName`, and `baseUrl` options that call passes, because an app reaching its provider only through a proxy has no other usable endpoint; those options still select the API key and base URL for the fallback client, which is built only when the factory returns `undefined`. Unlike `requiresApiKey()`, `sendPrompt` calls the factory fresh on every request rather than reading the cached probe, so a host that swaps its model at runtime takes effect on the next send. A factory that throws is logged and treated as `undefined`.

> **Upgrading from 0.28.x?** See the [0.29.0 migration guide](https://sqlrooms.org/upgrade-guide#_0-29-0-upcoming) for the full list of breaking changes: `parameters` → `inputSchema`, `component` → `toolRenderers`, `setSessionToolAdditionalData` removed.

```tsx
import {
  createAiSlice,
  type AiSliceState,
  type ToolRendererRegistry,
} from '@sqlrooms/ai-core';
import {
  BaseRoomStoreState,
  createBaseRoomSlice,
  createRoomStore,
} from '@sqlrooms/room-store';
import {tool} from 'ai';
import {z} from 'zod';

const EchoResult = ({
  output,
}: {
  output: {success: boolean; text: string} | undefined;
}) => <div>{output?.text}</div>;

type State = BaseRoomStoreState & AiSliceState;

export const {roomStore, useRoomStore} = createRoomStore<State>(
  (set, get, store) => ({
    ...createBaseRoomSlice()(set, get, store),
    ...createAiSlice({
      getInstructions: () => 'You are a helpful analytics assistant.',
      tools: {
        echo: tool({
          description: 'Echo text back',
          inputSchema: z.object({text: z.string()}),
          execute: async ({text}) => ({success: true, text: `Echo: ${text}`}),
        }),
      },
      toolRenderers: {
        echo: EchoResult,
      },
    })(set, get, store),
  }),
);
```

## Chat UI

```tsx
import {Chat} from '@sqlrooms/ai-core';

export function AiPanel() {
  return (
    <Chat>
      <Chat.Sessions />
      <Chat.Messages />
      <Chat.PromptSuggestions>
        <Chat.PromptSuggestions.Item text="What trends should I investigate first?" />
      </Chat.PromptSuggestions>
      <Chat.Composer
        placeholder="Ask a question"
        topActions={<Chat.PromptSuggestions.VisibilityToggle />}
      >
        <Chat.Composer.Attachments />
      </Chat.Composer>
    </Chat>
  );
}
```

When no chat session exists, the composer and prompt suggestions share the
transient `ai.draftPrompt` value. `ai.setDraftPrompt()` can populate that draft,
and the first `ai.createSession()` transfers it to the new session.

Use `Chat.Composer`'s `topActions` slot for compact controls that should sit in
the prompt's top row, right-aligned beside context selectors.

Attachments are opt-in. Add `<Chat.Composer.Attachments />` as a composer child
to accept images and plain-text or Markdown files. Its paperclip menu shows the
supported categories and opens a type-specific file picker for each one.
Pending files render in the composer footer and are sent as AI SDK file parts.
Posted files remain part of the user message: images open at full size in a
dialog, while text and Markdown open in a scrollable text or rendered-Markdown
dialog. The default limits are four files, 1 MiB per image and across all
pending images, 128 KiB per text file, and 128 KiB across all pending text
files; the component props can override those limits. A file can be sent
without adding prompt text.

> unconditionally, so passing it as a `Chat.Composer` child under
> `Chat.LocalAgentRoot` throws. Local-agent apps have no concept of a
> browser-held API key, so omit it there.

### Composable composer and prompt-suggestions primitives

`Chat.Composer` and `Chat.PromptSuggestions` are recipes: fully-styled,
opinionated defaults built on two lower layers that are themselves public API
for hosts that need a different visual shape.

**Layering**, thinnest to thickest:

1. **Behavior hooks** — `useChatComposer()` and `usePromptSuggestions()`. No
   DOM, no styling. Normalized state and actions that read identically
   whether the surrounding `Chat` is in session mode (`Chat.Root`) or
   local-agent mode (`Chat.LocalAgentRoot`).
2. **Unstyled primitives** — thin components built on the hooks above. All
   accept `asChild` (via Radix's `Slot`) to render as a single host-supplied
   child instead of their default DOM element, and none carry position,
   size, overflow, truncation, or other visual styling of their own.
3. **Recipes** — `Chat.Composer` and `Chat.PromptSuggestions`. SQLRooms' own
   opinionated, styled defaults, built entirely from the primitives above.
   Most apps only need these. Both supply their own state boundary, so they
   also work under a bare `RoomStateProvider` with no `<Chat>` ancestor —
   though as siblings that gives each its own state, so a shared pre-send
   policy needs a common ancestor (see below).

Reach for a lower layer only when a recipe's fixed appearance does not fit —
a host design system's own textarea, button, or list component, a
popover-anchored suggestions panel, or a horizontal carousel instead of the
vertical default.

`useChatComposer()` returns
`{mode, prompt, setPrompt, send, cancel, canSend, isRunning, isBusy, needsApiKey, sendBlocked}`.
Use it directly for anything that isn't textarea-shaped (a rich editor, a
custom input surface); `Input` below is built on it for the common textarea
case. It (and `ChatComposerStateBoundary`, for use outside any `<Chat>`
ancestor) is also how a suggestions list rendered elsewhere in the tree can
stay in sync with a composer mounted somewhere else.

Composer primitives (imported from `@sqlrooms/ai-core`, or via
`Chat.Composer.Input` / `.Send` / `.Stop` / `.DropTarget`):

* **`Input`** — binds the composer's prompt to a `<textarea>` (or, with
  `asChild`, a host-supplied one). Owns the Enter-to-send keymap (with an
  IME-composition guard and a no-modifiers check), optional auto-resize, and
  disables itself while busy. Host event handlers passed as props are
  merged, not replaced: the host's handler runs first, and calling
  `event.preventDefault()` suppresses this component's own behavior for that
  event — this is how `submitOnEnter` can be overridden by a host that wants
  full keymap control. Accepts a synchronous `onBeforeSend` pre-send veto
  (return `false` to abort a send).

  **The forwarded ref must reach the real DOM `<textarea>`.** With `asChild`,
  auto-resize measures and mutates inline `height` through the ref this
  component receives; if the host component that owns that ref does not
  forward it down to its own `<textarea>`, auto-resize silently does
  nothing — no error, and nothing a type check would catch.

* **`Send`** — sends the current prompt on activation. Renders nothing
  (`null`) while a run is in flight; disabled whenever `canSend` is `false`.
  Accepts the same synchronous `onBeforeSend` veto as `Input`.

  Both primitives render a `<button type="button">`, including under
  `asChild` — an untyped HTML button defaults to `submit`, which would post an
  enclosing host `<form>` and lose the draft. An `asChild` child that sets its
  own `type` keeps it.

* **`Stop`** — cancels the in-flight run on activation. Renders nothing while
  idle; never disabled once a run is in flight.

* **`DropTarget`** — marks an element as a drop target for in-app context
  items dragged into the composer (built on dnd-kit). **Handles in-app
  context items only, not file uploads** — dnd-kit observes pointer-driven
  drags between elements it manages, not native HTML5 file-drag events; a
  file drop needs a separate, native-drag-based primitive. **Requires
  `RoomDndProvider`**, not merely any dnd-kit `DndContext`: without a
  `DndContext` at all it throws rather than degrading to a no-op, and under a
  plain one it renders but never fires `onDrop`, because drops are accepted
  only for collisions carrying the `pointerWithin` marker that
  `RoomDndProvider`'s collision detector adds.

The styled **`Chat.Composer.Attachments`** recipe is intentionally separate
from those unstyled primitives: mounting it enables the file input and footer
previews for that chat root. For a custom attachment UI, use
`useChatAttachments()` under the same composer state boundary. Pass
asynchronous file preparation to `appendAsync` so a file that finishes reading
after the user switches sessions is discarded:

```tsx
const {appendAsync} = useChatAttachments();

await appendAsync(async () => [await fileToChatAttachmentPart(file)]);
```

### Pre-send policy: `useRegisterBeforeSend`

`onBeforeSend` on `Input` and `Send` vetoes sends from *that control*. When the
policy belongs to the chat rather than to one button — "create an artifact
before the first message", "route this through my own session management" —
register it on the composer state instead:

```tsx
useRegisterBeforeSend(
  useCallback((text: string) => (isAllowed(text) ? undefined : false), []),
);
```

Every send routed through `useChatComposer()`'s `send` then consults it,
whatever triggered it — the composer's own controls, a prompt suggestion row, a
command. This is what `Chat.Composer`'s `onRun` prop is built on, and why
clicking a suggestion cannot bypass a veto the composer enforces. The handler
is synchronous; return `false` to abort.

The registry is **one per `<Chat>` root**, which is what gives it that reach.
Two `Chat.Composer`s under one root are two views of one chat — same session,
same prompt — so a policy registered by either applies to sends from both;
independent surfaces need their own root, and a duplicate `onRun` warns in
development rather than merging silently.

Sharing is by React ancestry, which has one consequence worth knowing when
using the recipes **standalone**. `Chat.Composer` and `Chat.PromptSuggestions`
each supply their own state boundary when no `<Chat>` is above them, so as
siblings under a bare `RoomStateProvider` they get *separate* registries and a
suggestion click will not run the composer's `onRun`. Give them a common
`<Chat>` or `<ChatSuggestionsStateBoundary>` ancestor whenever the policy has
to span both — which is also what `<Chat>` does for you by default.

For a state that makes sending impossible outright rather than conditionally —
a missing credential, say — use `useBlockSends()` instead. It reports through
`useChatComposer()`'s `sendBlocked`, so `canSend` and suggestion rows render
disabled rather than looking live and doing nothing. `Chat.Composer` uses it
when it swaps to inline API-key entry.

`usePromptSuggestions()` returns
`{mode, visible, setVisible, toggle, items, isSessionEmpty, fill, send, isReadyToSend}`,
normalized the same way across both runtime modes. `send`/`isReadyToSend` reuse
the composer's own send action and readiness signals, so a suggestion and the
composer's send control can never disagree about whether sending is currently
possible — and any registered pre-send veto applies to both.

`isSessionEmpty` is true only when the chat has no messages *and* no
in-progress prompt, counting a draft typed before any session exists. Branch on
it to show suggestions only on a genuinely empty chat.

Suggestions primitives:

* **`Root`** — visibility gate: renders nothing when suggestions are hidden,
  its child otherwise. Accepts an `open` override for hosts whose own
  popover, dropdown, or overlay already owns open/closed state; pair it with
  `onOpenChange`, since while controlled the `VisibilityToggle` and `Dismiss`
  controls *inside* this root report through that callback instead of writing
  the store `open` overrides. Controls rendered outside a controlled root keep
  targeting the store, so controlling one list does not retarget unrelated
  toggles.
* **`Item`** — a single suggestion. Fills the prompt on activation by
  default; pass `submit` to send immediately instead. Disabled whenever
  `isReadyToSend` is `false`.
* **`VisibilityToggle`** — toggles visibility; exposes `aria-pressed` for
  styling pressed/unpressed. Inside a controlled `Root` it writes through
  `onOpenChange` rather than the overridden store, but since such a root
  renders nothing while hidden it can only close from there — render it
  outside the root for a control that also re-opens.
* **`Dismiss`** — hides suggestions unconditionally (unlike
  `VisibilityToggle`, it never re-shows them).

`useControlledVisibility()` returns the nearest controlled `Root`'s
`{visible, setVisible}`, or `null` when visibility is owned by the normalized
store. A host writing its own visibility control needs it: writing
`usePromptSuggestions().setVisible(false)` directly has no effect inside a
controlled root, whose `open` overrides the store. Prefer the controlled state
when it is present and fall back to the store otherwise, which is what
`Dismiss` and `VisibilityToggle` do.

None of the suggestions primitives carry position, size, overflow,
truncation, or tooltip styling — a host's own vertical list, popover, or
horizontal scroller owns all of that. `examples/ai-rag` builds a horizontal
carousel directly from these primitives (composed with `@sqlrooms/ui`'s
`ScrollableRow`) — it stays in the repo specifically to prove the primitives
impose no layout of their own, alongside `examples/ai`'s use of the vertical
recipe.

#### Breaking changes in this release

* **Local-agent `Enter` while streaming no longer stops the run.** It is now
  a no-op, matching session mode: `Enter` sends when ready, and never
  cancels a run in flight.
* **`Chat.PromptSuggestions` now defaults to a full-width vertical list**
  with click-to-send and CSS-ellipsis truncation (plus a native `title` for
  the full text), replacing the previous horizontal card carousel that
  filled the prompt for editing and truncated by character count. A
  horizontal layout is still available — build it from the suggestions
  primitives, as `examples/ai-rag` does.

### Customizable chat presentation

SQLRooms owns the **semantic model** for each turn (activity, status, reasoning,
outputs, timing, nesting, chronological grouping, hoist eligibility). Host apps
optionally own **presentation** (layout, disclosure, labels, styling, visibility)
through `Chat.Rendering`.

Most apps keep the polished default recipe and only need `<Chat.Messages />`.
Missing slots always inherit SQLRooms defaults; nested providers merge rather
than replace the parent recipe.

#### How `<Chat.Messages />` uses the slots

`<Chat.Messages />` is the session list surface: it derives chat turns from the
current session's `uiMessages` and renders one `ChatTurnView` per turn. It does
**not** own chrome for prompts, reasoning, tools, or answers.

Each `ChatTurnView` builds the turn's semantic model (what happened, in what
order, what is hoistable / running / completed), then asks the nearest
`Chat.Rendering` recipe to present it. The recipe is a map of slot components:

| Slot            | Role                                                          |
| --------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `ActiveStatus`  | Current in-flight run status and elapsed-time presentation    |
| `Turn`          | Full turn layout recipe — composes pre-wired semantic regions |
| `Prompt`        | User prompt and attachment chrome for the turn                |
| `Activity`      | Collapsible / status chrome around in-progress work           |
| `Reasoning`     | Model thinking / reasoning disclosure                         |
| `ToolActivity`  | One tool (or nested agent) line inside Activity               |
| `TextOutput`    | Assistant text / markdown answer regions                      |
| `HoistedOutput` | Rich tool UI lifted out of the activity stream                |
| `Error`         | Turn-level error feedback                                     |
| `Actions`       | Available per-turn operations such as copy and fork           |

Composition looks like this:

```text
Chat
└─ Chat.Rendering          ← optional; supplies / merges slot components
   └─ Chat.Messages        ← lists turns from the session
      └─ ChatTurnView      ← builds semantic model, then renders Turn
         └─ Turn           ← composes pre-wired regions
            ├─ Prompt
            ├─ Timeline    ← default source-order body
            ├─ Activity    ← aggregated activity for custom layouts
            ├─ Response / Summary
            ├─ HoistedOutputs
            ├─ Error
            └─ Actions
```

So:

* Wrap `<Chat.Messages />` in `<Chat.Rendering>` to change presentation for that
  subtree (or nest providers to layer overrides).
* Override leaf slots (`Prompt`, `Reasoning`, …) when you only need different
  look for those regions; `Turn` keeps deciding where they appear.
* Override `Turn` when the regional structure itself must change. It receives
  pre-wired region components, so it can reorder or omit regions without
  rebuilding search ids, tool classification, or leaf-slot props.

Without a `Chat.Rendering` ancestor, `ChatTurnView` uses the built-in SQLRooms
defaults for every slot.

#### Override a single slot

Pass a partial `components` map. Only the slots you provide change; everything
else keeps the SQLRooms (or parent) recipe.

**Activity chrome only** — keep default turn order and prompt/reasoning look:

```tsx
import {Chat, type ChatActivityProps} from '@sqlrooms/ai-core';

function AppActivity({children, isRunning, summaryLabel}: ChatActivityProps) {
  return (
    <section data-running={isRunning}>
      {summaryLabel ? <header>{summaryLabel}</header> : null}
      {children}
    </section>
  );
}

export function AiPanel() {
  return (
    <Chat>
      <Chat.Rendering components={{Activity: AppActivity}}>
        <Chat.Messages />
      </Chat.Rendering>
    </Chat>
  );
}
```

**Prompt look only** — restyle the user message bubble without touching turn
layout or tool activity:

```tsx
import {
  Chat,
  HighlightedChatSearchText,
  type ChatPromptProps,
} from '@sqlrooms/ai-core';

function AppPrompt({prompt, searchBlockId}: ChatPromptProps) {
  return (
    <blockquote className="border-l-2 pl-3">
      <HighlightedChatSearchText text={prompt} blockId={searchBlockId} />
    </blockquote>
  );
}

<Chat.Rendering components={{Prompt: AppPrompt}}>
  <Chat.Messages />
</Chat.Rendering>;
```

**Reasoning look only** — change thinking disclosure while keeping default
activity boxes and answer rendering:

```tsx
import {
  Chat,
  HighlightedChatSearchText,
  type ChatReasoningProps,
} from '@sqlrooms/ai-core';

function AppReasoning({text, isRunning, searchBlockId}: ChatReasoningProps) {
  return (
    <aside aria-busy={isRunning}>
      <strong>{isRunning ? 'Thinking…' : 'Thoughts'}</strong>
      <pre>
        <HighlightedChatSearchText text={text} blockId={searchBlockId} />
      </pre>
    </aside>
  );
}

<Chat.Rendering components={{Reasoning: AppReasoning}}>
  <Chat.Messages />
</Chat.Rendering>;
```

You can combine any of these in one `components` map by providing both the
`Prompt` and `Reasoning` entries.

**Active run status** — change or suppress the progress indicator without
reimplementing chat-run state derivation. The exported `getChatActiveStatus`
helper is also available when the indicator needs to be placed outside
`Chat.Messages`:

```tsx
import {Chat, type ChatActiveStatusProps} from '@sqlrooms/ai-core';

function AppActiveStatus({status}: ChatActiveStatusProps) {
  return <MyProgressIndicator label={status.label} />;
}

<Chat.Rendering components={{ActiveStatus: AppActiveStatus}}>
  <Chat.Messages />
</Chat.Rendering>;
```

Set `ActiveStatus` to a component that returns `null` when the host owns the
indicator's placement entirely. For that case, call `getChatActiveStatus` with
the current messages and `ToolRenderBehavior` to reuse the same status model.

`TextOutput` receives `isAnswer=true` only for text that is the final message
part. Planning text followed by tool activity remains regular response text.

**Tool activity** — customize top-level and nested tool or agent rows through
one normalized contract. `toolCall` is always present; `part` is only present
when the activity originated from a top-level AI SDK message part:

```tsx
import {Chat, type ChatToolActivityProps} from '@sqlrooms/ai-core';

function AppToolActivity({toolCall, isAgent}: ChatToolActivityProps) {
  return (
    <div data-state={toolCall.state}>
      {isAgent ? 'Agent' : 'Tool'}: {toolCall.toolName}
    </div>
  );
}

<Chat.Rendering components={{ToolActivity: AppToolActivity}}>
  <Chat.Messages />
</Chat.Rendering>;
```

The same recipe also applies inside nested agents. Similarly, an `Activity`
override controls their activity chrome when `nestedActivityMode="own-boxes"`.
For agent rows, `toolCall.agentToolCalls` follows live agent progress and then
the persisted final output, so the same renderer works during streaming.

**Action controls** — compose available operations without recreating their
behavior. Optional `copy` and `fork` objects are capabilities: omitting one
hides it, while its `Content` keeps the built-in control wired correctly:

```tsx
import {Chat, type ChatActionsProps} from '@sqlrooms/ai-core';

function AppActions({copy}: ChatActionsProps) {
  const Copy = copy?.Content;
  return (
    <div className="flex gap-1">
      {Copy && <Copy />}
      <MyCustomButton />
    </div>
  );
}

<Chat.Rendering components={{Actions: AppActions}}>
  <Chat.Messages />
</Chat.Rendering>;
```

Apps can replace a control's visuals while preserving its behavior:

```tsx
function AppActions({fork}: ChatActionsProps) {
  return fork ? <MyForkButton onClick={fork.run} /> : null;
}
```

An absent capability cannot be enabled accidentally: `fork` is only present
when the turn can actually be forked.

#### Fully custom turn layout

Override `Turn` when you need a different regional order or structure (for
example activity → response → hoisted → summary). Pair with
`nestedActivityMode="embed"` when nested agents should contribute log lines
into the parent Activity instead of creating their own boxes. Each region
exposes semantic data and a pre-wired `Content` component, so custom layouts
can inspect status and items without rebuilding search, tool, or hoist wiring:

```tsx
import {Chat, type ChatTurnSlotProps} from '@sqlrooms/ai-core';

function AppChatTurn({turn}: ChatTurnSlotProps) {
  const Prompt = turn.prompt.Content;
  const Activity = turn.activity.Content;
  const Response = turn.response.Content;
  const HoistedOutputs = turn.hoistedOutputs.Content;
  const Summary = turn.summary.Content;
  const Error = turn.error?.Content;
  const Actions = turn.actions.Content;

  return (
    <article data-turn-id={turn.id} aria-busy={!turn.isCompleted}>
      <Prompt />
      <Activity />
      <Response />
      <HoistedOutputs />
      <Summary />
      {Error && <Error />}
      <Actions />
    </article>
  );
}

<Chat.Rendering
  nestedActivityMode="embed"
  components={{Turn: AppChatTurn, Prompt: AppPrompt, Reasoning: AppReasoning}}
>
  <Chat.Messages />
</Chat.Rendering>;
```

Errors are deliberately separate from actions in the turn model. The default
layout keeps them adjacent, but a custom `Turn` may place or omit each region
independently.

Activity and hoisted-output regions are also disjoint: nested agent activity
contains status/log presentation, while nested rich outputs are rendered once
through `turn.hoistedOutputs` in decomposed layouts. The pre-wired `Timeline`
keeps owning both when the default source-order layout is used.

For finer composition, iterate semantic items and render their pre-wired leaf
components. Tool items expose state, agent, and hoist metadata:

```tsx
function AppActivity({turn}: ChatTurnSlotProps) {
  return turn.activity.items.map((item) => {
    const Content = item.Content;
    return (
      <section
        key={item.id}
        data-state={item.kind === 'tool' ? item.state : undefined}
      >
        <Content />
      </section>
    );
  });
}
```

Pair a custom `Turn` with leaf-slot overrides as needed. Prefer keeping the
default turn (or a host-owned turn recipe) and swapping only the slots that
must differ, unless the regional order itself has to change.

`Chat.Header` and `Chat.History` can delegate session creation to the host app
with `onCreateSession`. `Chat.History` also accepts `filterSession` and
`emptyLabel` so apps can present scoped histories without changing the generic
AI session schema.

`createAiSlice({onChatFinish})` lets host apps observe a non-aborted turn after
the completed messages have been persisted and the analysis has ended. Use this
for app-owned follow-up behavior, such as forking a completed chat into a new
workspace target, while keeping the generic AI slice unaware of app-specific
state.

### Optional timeout safety limits

Chat and tool timeouts are disabled by default. Apps can opt into a generous
run limit, an idle-stream watchdog, and tool execution limits through
`createAiSlice`. Timeout options are runtime behavior and are not persisted in
workspace configuration.

```ts
createAiSlice({
  tools,
  getInstructions,
  // Hybrid tools that omit `execute` on the configured remote endpoint.
  remoteClientToolNames: ['weather'],
  timeouts: {
    runMs: 30 * 60_000,
    idleStreamMs: 5 * 60_000,
    toolExecutionMs: 5 * 60_000,
    tools: {
      query: undefined, // Allow long-running queries.
      fetchMetadata: 30_000,
    },
  },
});
```

`runMs` covers the complete multi-step run. `idleStreamMs` resets when the UI
receives observable message progress and pauses while waiting for tool
approval. A silent operation that is still working is indistinguishable from a
stalled operation, so idle timeouts should remain conservative. Tool timeouts
abort the signal passed to the tool and fail its pending call; tools should
honor `abortSignal` to stop their underlying work promptly. Local executable
tools and registered tools awaiting client output are covered, including hybrid
client tools named by `remoteClientToolNames` whose remote definition omits
`execute`. Remote endpoints remain responsible for enforcing timeouts around
tools they execute server-side.

Assistant messages can be forked into a new active chat through
`ai.forkSessionFromMessage()`. The action snapshots the source session's
`uiMessages` through the selected message or chat turn, inherits the source
session's model and draft context item ids, records `sessionForks` provenance,
and lets `Chat.Messages` show a `Forked from` link back to the source chat.

Use `generateSessionTitle` when apps want an imperative helper that turns a
session's early user messages into a concise title via `ai.sendPrompt`, cleans
the model output, and renames the session. Use `useGenerateSessionTitle` in React
surfaces that should watch the current session and trigger the helper after new
user messages. The hook handles debouncing and duplicate-generation guards.
Apps can pass `enabled`, `isDefaultSessionName`, and `getPromptOptions` to keep
app-specific readiness checks and model choices outside the shared package.

## Local Agent Chat

Use `Chat.LocalAgentRoot` when a transient surface should be driven by a
pre-constructed `ToolLoopAgent` instead of the session-backed AI slice. The
message and composer components stay under the same `Chat` compound API.

```tsx
<Chat.LocalAgentRoot
  agent={agent}
  initialSuggestions={['Get started', 'Show me an example']}
  onMessagesChange={(msgs) => console.log(msgs)}
>
  <Chat.Messages />
  <Chat.PromptSuggestions />
  <Chat.Composer placeholder="Ask anything..." />
</Chat.LocalAgentRoot>
```

## Chat runtime providers

`Chat.Root` and `Chat.LocalAgentRoot` render one of two runtime providers that
the `Chat` message and composer components read via `useChatRuntime()`:

* `SessionChatRuntimeProvider` — the default. Selects the **session** runtime, so
  the UI is driven by the session-backed AI slice (`Chat.Root` wraps this).
* `LocalAgentChatRuntimeProvider` — selects the **local-agent** runtime, driving
  the same UI from a pre-constructed `ToolLoopAgent` with its own local message
  state (`Chat.LocalAgentRoot` wraps this). It takes the same props as
  `Chat.LocalAgentRoot` (`agent`, `initialMessages`, `initialSuggestions`,
  `onMessagesChange`).

The two are mutually exclusive modes, not layers: a `Chat` subtree is wrapped by
exactly one of them. Most apps use `Chat.Root` / `Chat.LocalAgentRoot` and never
touch these directly; they are exported for advanced setups that compose the
runtime themselves. Both must wrap the `Chat` components that call
`useChatRuntime()`; used outside a provider, the runtime defaults to session mode.

Session chat execution itself is owned by the AI slice, independently of these
presentation providers. `startAnalysis(sessionId)` lazily creates an ephemeral
chat runtime for the session, so a run can continue when no React chat surface is
mounted. `useSessionChat(sessionId)` only subscribes React to the runtime's chat.
Persisted messages and session state remain in `ai.config`, while SDK chat
instances, subscriptions, and timers remain ephemeral.

## Chat search

`Chat` renders a `ChatSearchProvider` and exposes `Chat.Search`, an in-conversation
find bar that highlights matches in the current session's messages.

For building search UIs outside the chat (e.g. a session list that searches across
all sessions), the underlying matching primitives are exported and can be used
without the provider:

* `normalizeChatSearchQuery(query)` — trims + lower-cases a query (the casing rule
  the search uses).
* `findChatSearchMatches(blocks, query)` — returns positional matches
  (`ChatSearchMatch[]`) for a list of `ChatSearchBlock`s. Useful for highlighting
  matched substrings consistently with `Chat.Search`.
* `markdownToPlainText(markdown)` — extracts plain text from markdown so message
  content can be made searchable.

```tsx
import {findChatSearchMatches, type ChatSearchBlock} from '@sqlrooms/ai-core';

const blocks: ChatSearchBlock[] = [
  {id: 'title', resultId: 'title', text: title},
];
const matches = findChatSearchMatches(blocks, query);
```

**Keeping highlighting in a replaced slot.** A host that swaps out a chat leaf
slot renders its own text, so it loses the highlighting the default slot got for
free. `HighlightedChatSearchText` restores it. Pass the same `blockId` the turn
model registered for that part; without it there are no matches to highlight and
the component renders the text unchanged. The `Prompt` slot example above shows
the shape.

Matches are wrapped in `<mark>`, and the active match carries the match id as its
DOM id, so a host can scroll it into view. `useOptionalChatSearch()` exposes the
same state directly (`activeMatchId`, `getMatchesForBlock`) for slots that need
to do their own anchoring. It returns `null` outside a `ChatSearchProvider`, so a
component rendered away from `Chat.Root` degrades instead of throwing.

Indexing follows what actually rendered, not just what got registered. A block
that a slot returns `null` for, or that stays hidden behind a user preference,
never mounts `HighlightedChatSearchText` (or the equivalent reporting) and so
contributes no matches. Search never points at content the user can't see.
The text a slot renders is also the text that gets indexed: `HighlightedChatSearchText`
matches and highlights against the `text` prop it was given, so a slot showing
a transformed or shortened string is searchable by what it actually displays,
not by whatever text the block was originally registered with.

Custom Markdown components are opaque rendering boundaries. Text beneath an
overridden Markdown element is excluded from automatic search because the
component may replace or hide its children; other default-rendered text in the
same message stays searchable. Overriding `mark` disables automatic search for
that message because generated highlights may never reach the DOM.

A slot that paints its own matches instead of rendering through
`HighlightedChatSearchText` must call `useReportRenderedChatSearchBlock(blockId)`
itself, or its block never counts as rendered and contributes no matches.

A slot that hides its content behind a disclosure or a toggle can key an effect
on `useActiveChatSearchMatchKey(blockId)` to reveal that content for every
selection attempt, including repeated navigation to the same match. This keeps
scrolling from landing on something still hidden and is what the default
reasoning disclosure uses to open itself.

## Devtools

`@sqlrooms/ai-core/devtools` exposes development-only inspection helpers and UI
for session debugging without adding the debug surface to the main
`@sqlrooms/ai-core` barrel.

```tsx
import {ChatSessionDebugView} from '@sqlrooms/ai-core/devtools';

function DebugPanel({
  sessionId,
  onClose,
}: {
  sessionId: string;
  onClose?: () => void;
}) {
  return <ChatSessionDebugView sessionId={sessionId} onClose={onClose} />;
}
```

`ChatSessionDebugView` reads the current AI store context and renders a tabbed
debug view for one chat session: the chronological timeline, registered tools,
run context, raw session JSON, model settings, tool calls, nested agent work,
and optional agent snapshots.

Agent snapshot capture is opt-in on `createAiSlice`:

```ts
createAiSlice({
  tools,
  getInstructions,
  devtools: {
    captureAgentSnapshots: true,
    persistAgentSnapshots: true,
    maxAgentSnapshotBytes: 64_000,
  },
});
```

Snapshots are bounded serializable metadata only: agent/tool names,
descriptions, capability flags, approval hints, and settings. They must not
store executable tools, closures, secrets, or unbounded prompt/output content.
Persist snapshots only for debugging workflows where cross-tab or post-mortem
inspection is useful.

Captured snapshots and snapshot controls live under the AI state's devtools
namespace:

```ts
const snapshots = useRoomStore((state) => state.ai.devtools.agentSnapshots);
state.ai.devtools.clearAgentSnapshots();
```

### Provider-context diagnostics

Provider-context capture is also opt-in. Enable it when creating the AI slice;
records are kept in memory and the oldest record is discarded when the limit
is exceeded (the default limit is `100`):

```ts
createAiSlice({
  tools,
  getInstructions,
  devtools: {
    captureProviderContexts: true,
    maxProviderContextRecords: 100,
  },
});

const providerContexts = useRoomStore(
  (state) => state.ai.devtools.providerContexts,
);
roomStore.getState().ai.devtools.clearProviderContexts();
```

Each `ProviderContextDiagnostic` describes one provider step using metadata
only: role, provider/model, session and step identifiers, instruction/message
sizes, tool names and schema sizes, source labels, optional preparation
metrics, and provider-reported input tokens when available. Raw instructions,
messages, and tool schemas are not copied into the record. The records are
transient devtools state and are also shown by `ChatSessionDebugView`.

Core chat and `ai.sendPrompt()` provider steps are captured automatically when
the option is enabled. Custom or nested agents can use
`state.ai.devtools.measureProviderContext(input)` to measure and append the same
record shape while respecting the capture flag. The main package also exports
`measureProviderContext`, `tryMeasureProviderContext`,
`MeasureProviderContextArgs`, and `ProviderContextDiagnostic` for integrations
that need to measure outside a slice method. `measureProviderContext` is the
strict helper and rejects measurement failures; `tryMeasureProviderContext` is
the fail-open request-path helper that logs a warning and returns `undefined`
so diagnostics cannot abort a valid provider request. Callers using either
standalone helper are responsible for writing the returned record to their
chosen diagnostics store.

### Forwarding execution scope into nested agents

Top-level tools receive the invoking turn's `sessionId` and `AiRunContext`
because the chat transport wraps `state.ai.tools` with `withRunContextTools`.
Tools handed to a nested `ToolLoopAgent` are not wrapped by the transport, so
without the same wrapper they execute with no scope and any target resolution
that defaults to "the current artifact/map" silently follows mutable UI
selection instead of the artifact captured when the prompt was submitted.

Wrap nested toolsets with the parent's execution options:

```ts
import {withRunContextTools} from '@sqlrooms/ai-core';

const nestedTool = tool({
  inputSchema,
  execute: async (input, options) => {
    const agent = new ToolLoopAgent({
      model,
      instructions,
      // `options` carries the parent turn's scope; forward it verbatim.
      tools: withRunContextTools(
        nestedTools,
        options as AiToolExecutionContext,
      ),
    });
    return streamSubAgent(
      agent,
      prompt,
      store,
      options.toolCallId,
      // The wrapper preserves `abortSignal` for the nested tools, but the
      // sub-agent loop itself only observes cancellation through this argument.
      options.abortSignal,
    );
  },
});
```

Forward `options.abortSignal` to `streamSubAgent`. `withRunContextTools` leaves
the signal intact for the tools the sub-agent calls, but the agent loop —
including the model stream and any approval wait — is only cancellable through
`streamSubAgent`'s fifth argument, so omitting it lets a stopped parent turn
leave the nested run going.

When a sub-agent stream fails, `streamSubAgent` throws `SUB_AGENT_ERROR_MESSAGE` rather than the provider's own text, and logs the raw error to the console. Callers serialize the thrown message into a tool result that the parent model receives, and a child agent can run on a different provider than its parent, so an exception carrying an endpoint, account detail, or credential would otherwise cross that boundary. A host that has verified parent and child share a trust boundary can pass `{formatError: getSubAgentErrorMessage}` as the sixth argument to get the underlying text back, or supply its own formatter. Local diagnostics are unaffected either way.

Pass the parent's `getAiRunContext` (not a copied `aiRunContext`) so an in-turn
retarget via `set_primary_context_artifact` is visible to subsequent nested tool
calls. Parent scope wins over inner options, so a nested agent cannot reassign
the owning session; fields the parent leaves `undefined` are preserved.

`AnalysisSessionSchema`, `isAnalysisSessionEmpty`, `AnalysisResultsContainer`,
`AnalysisResult`, `AnalysisAnswer`, `processAnalysisAnswerContent`, and
`cleanupPendingAnalysisResults` remain compatibility exports for existing apps.
New code should prefer `ChatSessionSchema`, `isChatSessionEmpty`,
`Chat.Messages`, `ChatTurnView`, `MessageContent`, `uiMessages`, and derived
`ChatTurn` helpers.

Legacy persisted sessions that contain `analysisResults` still load through
schema migration, but parsed and newly created chat sessions no longer include
that field.
