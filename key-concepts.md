# Key Concepts

## What's a Room?

A **Room** is a self-contained workspace where users can explore datasets, run queries, and view results. The term comes from [collaborative tools](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Collaborative_software)—where users work in shared spaces—and SQLRooms is built with future real-time collaboration in mind.

A Room consists of:

* `<RoomShell>`: a React component that renders the Room UI
* `roomStore`: a Zustand-based state store for the Room

## Room Store

The `roomStore` is a [composable](#composing-store-from-slices) [`Zustand`](/state-management#why-zustand) store created by calling `createRoomStore()`. The store holds:

* `config`: the persistable part of the state that captures a Room's saveable settings and can be serialized to JSON for storage or sharing including:
  * the view configuration and the layout state
  * the user preferences
* `room`: non-persistable state that holds runtime information like:
  * loaded DuckDB tables
  * transient UI state (like "query running")

```tsx
const {roomStore, useRoomStore} = createRoomStore<RoomConfig, RoomState>(
  (set, get, store) => ({
    ...createRoomShellSlice<RoomConfig>({
      config: {
        dataSources: [
          {
            type: 'url',
            url: 'https://.../earthquakes.parquet',
            tableName: 'earthquakes',
          },
        ],
      },
      room: {
        // Runtime state initialization…
      },
    })(set, get, store),
  }),
);
```

Check the [minimal example](https://github.com/sqlrooms/examples/blob/main/minimal/src/app.tsx) for the complete implementation.

***

## RoomShell

`<RoomShell>` is a React component that wraps your Room UI

* It injects the `roomStore` into React context, accessible via the `useRoomStore()` hook
* It sets up essential UI infrastructure including error boundaries, toast notifications, and tooltips, making it easy to use components from `@sqlrooms/ui` out of the box
* It provides slots for the optional `LayoutComposer` (see [Layout](#layout-optional) section below), `Sidebar`, and `LoadingProgress` components

```tsx
const App = () => (
  <RoomShell roomStore={roomStore}>
    <MyComponent />
  </RoomShell>
);
```

***

## SQL and DuckDB Access

SQLRooms includes a built-in DuckDB integration via the [`DuckDbSlice`](/api/duckdb/).
The `DuckDbSlice` provides helper functions for managing and querying tables:

* `findTableByName()` - Look up a table by name in the current schema
* `addTable()` - Add a new table from Arrow data or records
* `dropTable()` - Remove a table from the database
* `refreshTableSchemas()` - Update the cached table schemas
* `tables` - The cached list of tables from the last refreshTableSchemas() call
* `getConnector()` - Access the underlying DuckDB connector

You can query your datasets using the `useSql(query)` hook and work directly with Arrow tables in React.

```tsx
function MyComponent() {
  const isTableReady = useRoomStore((state) =>
    Boolean(state.db.findTableByName('earthquakes')),
  );
  const queryResult = useSql<{maxMagnitude: number}>({
    query: `SELECT max(Magnitude) AS maxMagnitude FROM earthquakes`,
    enabled: isTableReady,
  });
  const row = queryResult.data?.toArray()[0];
  return row ? `Max earthquake magnitude: ${row.maxMagnitude}` : <Spinner />;
}
```

For more details on DuckDB integration and available methods, see the [DuckDB API Reference](/api/duckdb/).

## Composing Store from Slices

The store can be enhanced with **slices**—modular pieces of state and logic that can be added to your Room. You can use slices from the `@sqlrooms/*` packages or create your own custom slices. Each slice is a function that returns a partial state object along with methods to modify that state.

Here's an example showing how to combine the default room shell with SQL editor functionality:

```tsx
const {roomStore, useRoomStore} = createRoomStore<RoomConfig, RoomState>({
  // Default slice
  ...createRoomShellSlice<RoomConfig>({
    config: {
      // Add SQL editor slice persistable config
      ...createDefaultSqlEditorConfig(),
    },
    room: {},
  })(set, get, store),

  // Mix in sql editor slice
  ...createSqlEditorSlice()(set, get, store),
});
```

You can access slices' namespaced config, state and functions in the store using selectors, for example:

```tsx
const queries = useRoomStore((state) => state.config.sqlEditor.queries);
const runQuery = useRoomStore((state) => state.sqlEditor.parseAndRunQuery);
```

Learn more about store and slices in [State Management](/state-management).

## Layout (Optional)

The `LayoutComposer` provides a flexible panel layout for your Room's UI.

* Panels are React components that can be plugged into the layout. They include metadata (`id`, `title`, `icon`) and a `component` to render.
* Panels can be moved, resized, or hidden
* Developers can add panels by registering them in the `roomStore`.
* Layout state is persisted in the `roomStore`

Configure the room layout and panels during store initialization:

```tsx
const {roomStore, useRoomStore} = createRoomStore<RoomConfig, RoomState>(
  (set, get, store) => ({
    ...createRoomShellSlice<RoomConfig>({
      config: {
        layout: {
          type: LayoutTypes.enum.mosaic,
          nodes: {
            // Data panel on left (30%) and main view on right
            direction: 'row',
            first: 'data-panel',
            second: MAIN_VIEW,
            splitPercentage: 30,
          },
        },
      },
      room: {
        // Define the available panels in the room layout
        panels: {
          'data-panel': {
            title: 'Data Sources',
            icon: DatabaseIcon,
            component: DataSourcesPanel,
            placement: 'sidebar',
          },
          main: {
            title: 'Main view',
            icon: () => null,
            component: MainView,
            placement: 'main',
          },
        },
      },
    })(set, get, store),
  }),
);
```

Layout composer renders the mosaic layout with panels:

```tsx
function App() {
  return (
    <RoomShell className="h-screen" roomStore={roomStore}>
      <RoomShell.Sidebar />
      <RoomShell.LayoutComposer />
    </RoomShell>
  );
}
```
